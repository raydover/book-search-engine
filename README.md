## Description

For this assignment, student coded using a Google Books API search engine. We were required to built our application with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app is built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, Node.js, Express.js server and API. We started with existing code to create a final product. 

## User Story

```
